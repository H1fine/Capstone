        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello, I'm Jasmine Boyd, a dedicated and versatile professional with a strong foundation in software development and network engineering. My journey into the world of technology began during my 10-year military service, where I was first introduced to computer systems while deployed in Baghdad. That pivotal experience sparked my passion for technology, and I've been committed to learning and growing in this dynamic field ever since. <br>

            I hold certifications in software development and networking, and I’m currently pursuing a degree in Network Engineering to deepen my expertise. With a blend of technical skills and a background in Human Resources, I bring a unique perspective to problem-solving and collaboration in team environments. <br>
            
            Outside of coding, I’m a proud mom to two amazing kids and two adorable guinea pigs. I enjoy arts and crafts, cooking, and traveling, all of which fuel my creativity and adaptability—qualities I bring into my professional work. <br>
            
            As I build my career in software development, I aim to combine my technical skills with my passion for accessibility and inclusion. I’m also working on a business idea, EZ Access Solutions, which incorporates sensory gaming to support individuals with special needs. <br>
            
            Feel free to explore my portfolio to see the projects I’ve worked on and the skills I bring to the table. I’m excited to connect and collaborate on innovative solutions!</p>
